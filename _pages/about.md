MSc. Financial Engineering alumni at Bogazici University, Bachelor Business Administration alumni at Hacettepe University. Experienced in asset management and highly curious to quantitative finance.


Current Pursuits in Data-Driven Finance

I work on public financial databases and create data-intensive financial analysis scripts and solutions for research and personal projects. I develop my projects using the Python coding language and some of my work can be found on this website and my [GitHub page](https://github.com/alihanucar).
