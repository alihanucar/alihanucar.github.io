Education and Experiences
======

I was born and raised in Mersin, Turkey in 1996 as an only child. In September 2014, I moved to Ankara to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration at Hacettepe University. During my studies, I developed an interest in quantitative finance and investment analysis, and I chose to build my career in this field. I gained practical experience through internships at the Istanbul Stock Exchange and Crosslytics, a cryptocurrency start-up in Kyiv, Ukraine in the summer of 2018 and besides of that i also participated and organized global and local volunteering projects.

After completing my studies, I joined Garanti BBVA Securities as a Sales Trainee, but I left after six months due to personal and ethical values. In early 2020, I joined İş Asset Management as an Assistant Specialist in the Distribution Channel Management team. Over the course of two and a half years, I was promoted to Specialist and gained recognition from my colleagues and managers for my enthusiasm and curiosity.

I returned to university in 2021 to pursue a Master's degree in Financial Engineering at Bogazici University. I successfully graduated in January 2023 and am now working as a Control Analyst Assistant at DHL Express, based in Leipzig, Germany.
