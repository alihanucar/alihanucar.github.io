About My Personality
------

I am a 10-year licensed fitness athlete who thrives on challenges and growth through struggle. I approach life with discipline, dedication, sarcams and sense of humor. In my personal time, I work on public financial databases and create data-intensive financial analysis scripts and solutions for research and personal projects. I develop my projects using the Python coding language and some of my work can be found on my website and [GitHub page](https://https://github.com/alihanucar).
